 # Named entity recognition (NER)
  Named entity recognition (NER) with some Python coding. NER is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that identifies and classifies named entities in text. Named entities can be people, places, organizations, products, events, and other types of entities.

1. Search: NER can be used to improve search engines by identifying the entities that users are searching for. For example, if a user searches for "Tesla," a search engine that uses NER can identify that Tesla is a company and return results that are relevant to Tesla the company, rather than Tesla the person.
2. Recommendation: NER can be used to improve recommendation systems by identifying the entities that users are interested in. For example, if a user reads an article about Elon Musk, a recommendation system that uses NER can identify that Elon Musk is a person and recommend other articles about Elon Musk to the user.
3. Customer care service: NER can be used to improve customer care service by identifying the entities that customers are talking about. For example, if a customer submits a support ticket about a problem with their computer, a customer care system that uses NER can identify that the computer is a product and route the ticket to the appropriate team.

SpaCy is a popular NLP library that includes a built-in NER component. The speaker will show how to use spaCy to identify the entities in a text and how to customize the NER model to recognize specific types of entities.
