**What is NLP Pipeline?**

NLP pipeline is a series of steps that are involved in building a real-life NLP application. These steps include:

1. **Data Acquisition:** This is the process of collecting the data that you will need to train your NLP model. This data can come from a variety of sources, such as public datasets, web scraping, or internal databases.

2. **Text Extraction and Cleanup:** This step involves cleaning up the data by removing irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words. You may also need to correct spelling mistakes and normalize text.

3. **Preprocessing:** This step involves converting the text data into a format that can be understood by a machine learning model. This may involve tokenizing the text, stemming or lemmatizing the words, and creating features.

4. **Feature Engineering:** This step involves extracting features from the text data that will be used to train the machine learning model. These features can be based on the words themselves, the order of the words, or the context of the words.

5. **Model Building:** This step involves training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. The type of model that you use will depend on the specific task that you are trying to solve.

6. **Model Evaluation:** This step involves evaluating the performance of the model on a held-out dataset. This will help you to determine how well the model generalizes to new data.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring:** This step involves deploying the model to production and monitoring its performance over time. You may need to retrain the model periodically as new data becomes available.

**Example Use Case: Camtasia Support Ticket System**

The video discusses an example use case of NLP pipeline, which is the Camtasia support ticket system. In this use case, the goal is to create a machine learning model that can automatically classify support tickets as high, medium, or low priority.

The steps involved in building this model are as follows:

1. **Data Acquisition:** The data for this model is collected from the Camtasia support ticket system. This data includes the title and description of each ticket, as well as the priority that was assigned to the ticket by a human agent.

2. **Text Extraction and Cleanup:** The text data is cleaned up by removing irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words. Spelling mistakes are also corrected.

3. **Preprocessing:** The text data is tokenized, stemmed, and converted into a numerical format that can be understood by the machine learning model.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Features are extracted from the text data that will be used to train the machine learning model. These features include the frequency of certain words, the presence of certain keywords, and the sentiment of the text.

5. **Model Building:** A naive Bayes classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on a held-out dataset. The results show that the model is able to classify tickets with an accuracy of 85%.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring:** The model is deployed to production and monitored for performance. The model is retrained periodically as new data becomes available.

**Conclusion**

NLP pipeline is a complex process that involves a number of steps. However, by following these steps, you can build a machine learning model that can solve real-world NLP problems.
