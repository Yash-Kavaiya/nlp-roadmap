## NLP Usecases

- Gmail's auto-complete feature, which uses NLP to predict what you are typing.
- Spam filters, which use NLP to identify and filter out spam emails.
- Google Translate, which uses NLP to translate text from one language to another.
- Chatbots, which use NLP to understand and respond to customer queries.
Voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, which use NLP to understand and respond to voice commands.
- Google Search, which uses NLP to understand and answer your search queries.
- Automated news generation, which uses NLP to generate news articles from data.

## Application of NLP

Sure, here are some applications of NLP:

* **Machine translation:** NLP is used to automatically translate text from one language to another. This technology is used by Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and other translation services.

* **Chatbots and virtual assistants:** NLP is used to develop chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to natural language. These chatbots can be used for customer service, technical support, and other applications.

* **Text summarization:** NLP is used to automatically summarize large amounts of text into a shorter, more manageable format. This technology can be used to summarize news articles, academic papers, and other documents.

* **Sentiment analysis:** NLP is used to analyze text to identify the sentiment of the author, such as whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. This technology can be used to understand customer feedback, analyze social media sentiment, and track brand reputation.

* **Question answering:** NLP is used to automatically answer questions posed in natural language. This technology can be used to develop chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications that can provide information to users.

* **Named entity recognition:** NLP is used to identify and classify named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations. This technology can be used to populate knowledge bases, extract information from documents, and improve search accuracy.

* **Text classification:** NLP is used to classify text into a predefined set of categories. This technology can be used to filter spam, categorize customer support tickets, and route emails to the appropriate department.

* **Speech recognition:** NLP is used to convert spoken language into text. This technology is used by voice assistants, dictation software, and other applications.

* **Text generation:** NLP is used to generate new text, such as poetry, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. This technology can be used to create chatbot responses, summarize documents, and generate creative content.

* **Language modeling:** NLP is used to build models of natural language that can be used to generate new text. This technology can be used to create chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications that can interact with users in a natural way.

These are just a few of the many applications of NLP. As NLP technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and useful applications in the years to come.

## What is NLP
NLP is a filed in computer science and AI that gives machines an ability to understand human language better and assist in language related tasks

Sure, here is a short description of some of the most popular NLP libraries:

## Some famous NLP Library 

* **SpaCy** is a powerful open-source NLP library for Python that provides a wide range of features for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and word vectors. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice for production applications.

* **Gensim** is another popular open-source NLP library for Python that focuses on topic modeling, a technique for identifying the underlying topics in a collection of documents. It also offers features for document similarity, word embeddings, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

* **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) is a comprehensive open-source NLP library for Python that offers a wide range of features for tasks such as tokenization, normalization, stemming and lemmatization, parsing, and semantics. It is a well-established and widely used library, making it a good choice for beginners and researchers.

* **PyTorch** is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python that can be used for a variety of NLP tasks, including deep learning, natural language generation, and question answering. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it a good choice for beginners and researchers.

* **Hugging Face Transformers** is a popular open-source NLP library that provides a collection of pre-trained transformer models for tasks such as natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), and machine translation. Transformer models are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for NLP tasks, and the Hugging Face Transformers library makes it easy to use these models in your own projects.

* **TensorFlow** is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python that can be used for a variety of NLP tasks, including deep learning, natural language generation, and question answering. It is a powerful and versatile library, but it can also be more complex to use than some of the other libraries on this list.

These are just a few of the many great NLP libraries available for Python. The best library for you will depend on your specific needs and experience.
