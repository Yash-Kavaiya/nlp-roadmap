# The three categories are:
## 1 * Rules and heuristic: 
This is the simplest approach and does not involve any machine learning or deep learning. It is based on rules and heuristics that are written by hand.
## 2. Machine learning: 
This approach uses machine learning algorithms to learn from data. The data can be labeled or unlabeled.
## 3. Deep learning: 

This approach uses deep learning algorithms to learn from data. Deep learning algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that are able to learn from large amounts of data.
